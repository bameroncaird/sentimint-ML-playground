The only files needed are vocab.tfidf, model.svm, and SentiMint_kNN.py

To use the kNN predictor you will need to import SntiMint_kNN.py amd create a sntimint-kNN object.
You then call the predict function from that object and pass the string to be analyzed. 
You can see test.py for an example

vocab.tfidf and model.svm should be in the same directory as SentiMint_kNN.py and should NOT be renamed
