### README

This repository is for experimenting with the machine learning part of Sentimint, our senior capstone project.

The virtual environment we used can be recreated with the command: 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

We ended up implementing logistic regression, support vector machines and k nearest neighbors to classify pieces of text as positive, negative, or neutral.
